A variety of miscellaneous system file mods for the Nintendo 3DS.

<p class="note-blue">
  Create a NAND backup before modifying any system files!
  Modifying the system file is safe since Boot9Strap provides brick protection,
  allowing recovery with GodMode9.
  If you messed up and the Home Menu fails to launch, use GodMode9 to
  restore the system file.
