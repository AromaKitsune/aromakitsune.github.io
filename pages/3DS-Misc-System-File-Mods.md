A variety of miscellaneous system file mods for the Nintendo 3DS.

<div class="note-blue">
  <p>
    Luma3DS custom firmware is required to use the mod.
    <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/" target="_blank">
    Install CFW if you haven't already.</a>
  </p>

<div class="note-blue">
  <p>
    Create a NAND backup before modifying any system files!
    Modifying the system file is safe since Boot9Strap provides brick
    protection, allowing recovery with GodMode9. If you messed up and the Home
    Menu fails to launch, use GodMode9 to restore the system file.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="note-red">
  <p>
    These modded system files are not signed, do NOT uninstall CFW!
