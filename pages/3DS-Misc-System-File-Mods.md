A variety of miscellaneous system file mods for the Nintendo 3DS.

<p class="note-blue">
  Luma3DS custom firmware is required to use the mod.
  <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/" target="_blank">
  Install CFW if you haven't already.</a>
</p>

<p class="note-blue">
  Create a NAND backup before modifying any system files!
  Modifying the system file is safe since Boot9Strap provides brick protection,
  allowing recovery with GodMode9.
  If you messed up and the Home Menu fails to launch, use GodMode9 to
  restore the system file.
