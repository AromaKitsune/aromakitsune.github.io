## Installing a custom Home Menu UI (LayeredFS)

2. Extract the zip file and enter the `LayeredFS` folder.

3. Choose the region folder that matches your 3DS region.

4. Copy the `luma` folder to the root of the SD Card.

5. Launch the Luma3DS config by holding the `Select` button while booting.

6. Activate "Enable game patching".

7. Save and exit.

8. A custom Home Menu UI has been installed.

## Restoring the Home Menu UI (LayeredFS)

1. Launch the Luma3DS config by holding the `Select` button while booting.
